# Homepage Customization Integration Tests

See package README for details on building and running.

Goal with this file organization is

- improve maintenance of tests by decreasing chance of conflicts as different features are added to overlapping areas
- provide ability to target specific features without modifying the test file with '.only' changes

# Static data

N/A - all test data (other than cvent accounts) are created and torn down dynamically
