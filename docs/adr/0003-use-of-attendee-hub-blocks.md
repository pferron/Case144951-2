# 3. Use of Attendee Hub Blocks

Date: 2022-02-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

At the request of Product and UX, we reached out to the blocks team to see if it makes sense to use Blocks at this time.

Blocks in Attendee Hub Figma (you might need permissions from UX to view) https://www.figma.com/file/1nskQ2qPXSGiItYRTdyLKP/Blocks?node-id=1208%3A120879
 
Blocks POC in Attendee Hub https://stash.cvent.net/projects/AX/repos/attendee-experience-web/pull-requests/5776/overview

## Decision

At this time, we don't think that Block specifically is of use to us (there really isn't anything we can use at this time).  However, we will structure the theme setup and use of Carina components (especially custom components) to make sure they are taking proper advantage of the theme color/font/etc tags.

## Consequences

We should be setup to take advantage of Blocks at a future time if we think it is of benefit at that time.
